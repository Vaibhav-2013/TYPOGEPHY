Space exploration is the study of space beyond Earth. Astronauts travel in rockets to explore space. They wear special
suits to stay safe. Astronauts visit space stations to live and work in space. They do experiments to learn about
planets and stars. The Moon was the first place astronauts visited. One day, astronauts may go to Mars! Space
exploration helps us learn more about the universe. Scientists use telescopes and robots to study space, too. Space is
full of mysteries, and astronauts help us discover them. Would you like to be an astronaut and explore the stars?

Space exploration means traveling beyond Earth to learn about space. Astronauts go on space missions in rockets. They
wear special suits and live in space stations for weeks or months. Astronauts do science experiments to understand space
better. They float in space because there is no gravity. The first astronaut on the Moon was Neil Armstrong in 1969.
Today, astronauts work on the International Space Station (ISS). Scientists also send robots and telescopes to explore
faraway planets and stars. One day, astronauts may travel to Mars! Space exploration helps us learn about our planet and
the universe. It also helps invent new technology for space and Earth. Being an astronaut is exciting and takes lots of
training. Astronauts must be strong and smart to work in space. They help us discover amazing things beyond our world.
Do you dream of becoming an astronaut and exploring space?
